# 🎵 Soundbite Frontend

Audio Streaming service where you can upload and share your audios.

Obviusly this proyect is linked with the [SoundBite-Backend✨](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/soundbite-backend) repo.

This project was created for educational purposes and uses React, Axios, and MaterialUI icons.

During this project, I learned and practiced:
* React (obviously the main purpose why I'm doing this) 🚀
* react-router (used in the "Share" component) 🛣️
* CSS Grid (amazing capabilities) 🎨
* Audio stream management. 🎧
* useRef (in React) 🆔
* Conditional rendering 🤔
* And more... 💪
